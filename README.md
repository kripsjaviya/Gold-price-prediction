## Introduction

This is a Machine Learning model designed to predict the price of Gold using historical data and various factors that impact the price of Gold.

## Data Collection

The model uses historical data from the past 10 years to train and make predictions. The data is collected from reliable sources such as Yahoo Finance and Investing.com. The data includes daily prices of Gold, SPX, USO, SLV, and EUR/USD.

## Data Pre-Processing

The collected data is cleaned to remove any missing values or outliers. The data is then transformed to ensure that it is in the appropriate format for use in the model.

## Data Analysis

The data is analyzed to identify any patterns or relationships between the various factors that impact the price of Gold. This analysis is used to engineer features that are used to train the model.

## Train Test Split

The data is split into a training set and a testing set. The training set is used to train the model, while the testing set is used to evaluate the performance of the model.

## Model Development

The model is developed using a Random Forest Regressor algorithm. The algorithm is trained on the historical data and various features that impact the price of Gold. Once the model is trained, it is tested on the testing set to evaluate its accuracy.

## Evaluation

The accuracy of the model is evaluated using various metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). These metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the model and to identify areas where the model can be improved.

## Future Work

In the future, we plan to expand the scope of the model to include more factors that impact the price of Gold. We also plan to explore different algorithms to improve the accuracy of the model.
